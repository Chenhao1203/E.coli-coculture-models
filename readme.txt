All models were built in Python 3. The three files in '.py' format each represent the three growth models.

Run the following files in Python 3 with sympy,numpy,pandas,OS and pickle library.

'1. independent growth.py' 
	to generate indepentent growth co-culture model with different μm2.

'2. unidirectional cross-feeding.py' 
	to generate a unidirectional cross-feeding co-culture model with different μm2, 
	and with different initial population ratio. 

'3. bidirectional cross-feeding.py' 
	to generate a bidirectional cross-feedingco-culture model with different μm2.

All data will be exported in CSV format and can be further processed using Origin 9.0 or Microsoft Excel.
